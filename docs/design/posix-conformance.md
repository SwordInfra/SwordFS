# POSIX conformance

SwordFS uses upstream `pjdfstest` as a semantic conformance signal. The goal is
not to hide currently unsupported behavior or require the whole upstream suite
to be green while SwordFS is still in beta. The conformance system separates
observation from the regression contract so capability debt stays visible and
already-supported semantics cannot silently regress.

## Namespace component limits

SwordFS treats the maximum pathname-component length as a metadata namespace
invariant rather than a syscall-specific rule. A single component may contain
at most 255 bytes. Every metadata entry point that accepts a directory-entry
name validates that component before ordinary lookup or mutation, so an
overlong component returns `ENAMETOOLONG` instead of being collapsed into a
later error such as `ENOENT`.

The rule applies consistently to lookup, create, mkdir, unlink, rmdir,
symlink, hard-link destination names, and both source and destination names of
rename. Memory and persistent metadata backends share the same limit and
validation contract; backend-specific storage or lookup behavior must not
change this error precedence.

## Model

The upstream revision is pinned in `conformance/pjdfstest/version.env`. A run
executes every relevant `tests/**/*.t` script against one privileged SwordFS
FUSE mount and preserves each script's TAP output. Assertions are identified as
`tests/<category>/<file>.t#<n>`; this avoids broad file-level skips and makes the
baseline stable at a pinned upstream revision.

Two project-owned baseline files interpret those observations:

- `supported.txt` lists assertions SwordFS claims to support. They must pass.
- `known-gaps.tsv` lists expected failures with an explicit category, linked
  Issue, and reason. Supported assertions and known gaps are mutually
  exclusive.

Both files use exact assertion selectors. A selector may compact adjacent IDs,
for example `tests/open/00.t#1-4,7,9-12`; ranges expand to those exact assertion
IDs. Wildcards and whole-file exclusions are deliberately unsupported, so a
passing assertion cannot be hidden by a broad expected-failure rule.

The classifier applies this state model:

```text
supported + PASS       -> PASS
supported + FAIL       -> REGRESSION (blocking)

known gap + FAIL       -> KNOWN_* (reported, not hidden)
known gap + PASS       -> XPASS (blocking until baseline is tightened)

unclassified + PASS    -> UNCLASSIFIED_PASS (blocking baseline debt)
unclassified + FAIL    -> UNEXPECTED_FAIL (blocking)

upstream SKIP/TODO     -> UPSTREAM_NOT_APPLICABLE
baseline + SKIP/TODO   -> BASELINE_NOT_APPLICABLE (blocking)
malformed/incomplete TAP -> INFRASTRUCTURE (blocking)
```

Treating an unclassified pass as baseline debt is deliberate: the supported
set remains explicit and monotonic instead of allowing newly working behavior
to exist outside the regression contract.

Known-gap categories are `known_unsupported`, `known_semantic_defect`, and
`environment`. Environment entries are reserved for reproducible limitations
of the supported runner rather than ordinary harness failures. Build, mount,
dependency, malformed-TAP, timeout, and similar harness failures are
infrastructure failures and block the job.

## Execution and CI

`scripts/run-pjdfstest.sh` owns the privileged execution environment. It:

1. checks out the exact upstream revision;
2. builds the upstream `pjdfstest` helper;
3. starts the same Redis/MinIO services used by SwordFS E2E tests;
4. formats and mounts a dedicated SwordFS volume with `allow_other` so
   pjdfstest assertions that change effective UID/GID can reach FUSE;
5. runs every upstream test script in an isolated directory on that mount;
6. preserves raw TAP, per-script exit status, SwordFS logs, and environment
   metadata; and
7. unmounts SwordFS and tears down dependencies even on failure.

The GitHub Actions conformance job builds SwordFS in Release mode and runs the
harness as root. `scripts/pjdfstest_classify.py` then creates `result.json` and
`report.md`. Strict classification is the regression gate; raw upstream exit
status is not used as a proxy for SwordFS support.

The normal E2E job remains separate. Conformance has different privilege,
baseline, reporting, and failure semantics and must not be reduced to another
GTest pass/fail bit.

## Metrics

The report exposes three different percentages:

```text
overall support = PASS /
  (PASS + KNOWN_UNSUPPORTED + KNOWN_SEMANTIC_DEFECT + blocking semantic fail)

supported regression pass = supported PASS / all observed supported assertions

classified rate = classified relevant assertions / all relevant assertions
```

`environment` and `upstream_not_applicable` do not enter the overall-support
denominator. Supported regression pass and classified rate both target 100%.
Per-category support is reported independently so a large test family cannot
hide a weak semantic area.

## Baseline lifecycle

The initial infrastructure run is expected to expose unclassified assertions.
Use its generated bootstrap candidates to establish the first baseline:

- every observed unclassified pass becomes a supported assertion;
- failures are grouped by semantic root cause or unsupported capability;
- one focused GitHub Issue may own many failing assertion IDs;
- each failure is then recorded in `known-gaps.tsv` with that Issue and a
  concrete reason.

Do not create one Issue per assertion and do not use a broad file/category skip
to make the job green. If one failing prerequisite causes a test script to
abort before its declared TAP plan completes, fix or explicitly investigate
that root cause; incomplete TAP is not silently converted into semantic debt.

After the baseline exists, the supported set is monotonic. Removing an entry
because it regressed is prohibited unless SwordFS intentionally changes the
current semantic contract. PR CI compares `supported.txt` with the PR base and
rejects removals by default. An intentional contract change must be made
explicit with the `conformance-semantic-change` PR label so the exceptional
removal is visible in review. A known gap that starts passing is XPASS and must
be moved into the supported set in the same change.

When a root-cause Issue is resolved, re-evaluate **every selector linked to that
Issue**, not only assertions that became XPASS. A prerequisite failure can
create many downstream failures; after the prerequisite is fixed, a downstream
assertion may still fail for a different reason. Such assertions must be moved
to the newly demonstrated root cause instead of remaining hidden behind the
old Issue classification.

The same re-attribution rule applies even when no implementation change makes an
assertion pass. If raw TAP evidence shows that a failure is only a downstream
consequence of another unsupported prerequisite or defect, the baseline must
move that assertion to the actual prerequisite Issue immediately. A still-red
assertion is not evidence that its previous root-cause classification remains
valid.

Updating the pinned pjdfstest revision is an explicit reviewable change. Run
the new revision, inspect the baseline delta, classify added/changed assertions,
and only then update the baseline.

## Artifacts and public status

Each CI run uploads raw TAP, classified JSON, the Markdown report, SwordFS
runtime logs, and environment metadata. PR runs are previews only and cannot
change canonical project status.

Authoritative `main` runs publish the latest report and machine-readable result
to the isolated `pjdfstest-status` branch. The top-level README links to that
stable branch. Publication also keeps `history.json` and a compact historical
trend in `status.md`; it never creates generated commits on `main` or recursively
triggers source CI.

`history.json` retains every authoritative run for machine-readable audit and
diagnostics. The human-readable historical trend is intentionally sparser: it
adds a point only when `Overall support`, `Supported gate`, or `Classified`
changes from the preceding trend point, whether the value increases or
decreases. Runs that only repeat the same metrics, including infrastructure-only
status changes without classified metrics, do not add trend rows.

If the latest main run has semantic blockers, the status page records that
failed result. If the conformance job fails before a classified report exists,
publication records an infrastructure failure rather than leaving an older
healthy status presented as current.
